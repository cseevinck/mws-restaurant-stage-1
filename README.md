####  Project - Restaurant Reviews

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I took a static design that lacks accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for all Udacity students. 

### Specification

I was provided with the code for a restaurant reviews website. My task was to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

### Project Rubric

The project will be evaluated by a Udacity code reviewer according to the [Restaurant Reviews project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1090/view). 

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). 

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future-proofing JavaScript code. I maintained use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.

## Instructions
In a terminal from inside the project directory, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, start the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.

With the server running, access the site in a web browser at: http://localhost:8000

## Issues
- I cannot figure out how to get favicon to work with the SimpleHTTPServer in hosted site.
